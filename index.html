                The following is a checklist and set of information I use when playing Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition. 
                The checklist is completely imported from the most suitable guide I found on the net, created in 1999 
                from <a href="mailto:wizards@charm.net">Al Giovetti</a> (Actual walkthrough at this <a href="http://www.thecomputershow.com/computershow/walkthroughs/baldursgatewalk.htm">website</a>). This checklist was created by adopting the source 
                code from the <a href="https://github.com/smcnabb/dark-souls-2-cheat-sheet/tree/gh-pages">Dark Souls 2 Cheat Sheet</a> created by <a href="https://github.com/smcnabb">Stephen McNabb</a>.  
                If this is your first time visiting this page please check
                out the Help section.

He can be killed quite easily and after death turns into a phoenix guard which can be killed again (didn't ressurect itself after death for me). Phoenix guard gives your 100 exp and Daer himself only 10. On Daer's corpse there is around 50 gold. As a side note, if you stand close enough (fireball radius) from Oublek the Nashkel task master, when phoenix guard dies, he does not survive the fire.

The three exits to go down farther are in the SE corners of each level of the mines. The entrance to the last level, the third, is hard to find, but head South to where there is a ghoul and two spiders, kill those then head east. there are traps by the door above the lake, disarm them and enter the door (use thief skill after find traps skill) the bad man is in the ONLY entrance across the water, there are a couple of Kobold commandos near the entrance as a nice little marker with their pretty fire arrows.

Go west of the farm and you will see a big hole in the ground. It's a big Ankheg lair. Go into it. This area is kinda hard, so if you have a theif in your party with good stealth just hide him/her and go into the hole. Leave the non-stealth party members outside. If you had little or no trouble killing the Ankheg in the Farmer's feild then you can just take your entire party. Anyway, the boy is in a treaser pile in the north northwest part of the cave, you can't miss it. There are also some nice goodies in the stash. Hope this helps. Return to Farmer Brun later, or talk to him twice after you retrieve his son and you can give him 100 gold for 500 additional experience points. If you retrieve his son before talking with him, just talk to him three times to get the conversation about giving the farmer money.</li>

You can kill the guys on the top level of the mansion or search the mansion until you find out that Reitar is in Candlekeep. The Iron Throne Mansion has five levels, maps 0612 to 0616. One level is in the basement accessed by stairs to the right of the door out to the street. The basement goes to the sewers in the northwest of the westernmost section of them through the area that goes directly west (left) from the top intersection of the west sewer section. The other areas go to the top floor. If you go all the way to the top, you will have a big fight. On the first floor, we told the guard we were merchants from Sembia with business with the Iron Throne leaders. On the second floor we told the guard we were delivering a message to Sarevok. On the third floor we told them we were merchants from Sembia. Dustus Gurn, assistant chief accountant, told us that Rieltar and Brunos went to Candlekeep. If you threaten Thaldorn on level three of the Iron Throne he will tell you that Bruno and Rietar have gone to Candlekeep. If you kill the guys on the fourth floor, get the documents describing their plan, the letter from Tulth to Rieltar. You will find Zalamar Cloud Wulfe, Gardush, Naamanj Diyab, Asim and Ala, and Lyle Espejo on the fourth floor. Save the game. Take these documents back to Scar and he will take you to Duke Elton. If you cannot find Scar after looking go directly to the Duke. The chapter ends when you report to Duke Elton. Elton gives you the tome of great value which you will need to get into Candlekeep in chapter 6. You are immediately teleported to Candlekeep so if you had not slots open, the tome is dropped on the ground and you have to retun to Duke Elton's room to get it. Alternatively, you can go directly to Duke Eltan on the second floor of the Flaming Fist garrison and get the task to investigate the Iron Throne, and return to Elton later to report your findings after finding out that Reitar is in Candlekeep.</li>

                    <li data-id="playthrough_19_21">This area has bassilisks in it so be sure to be carrying scrolls of protection from putrefaction which last longer and more reliably than the potions of silver eyes.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_19_22">Close to the exit in the southwest (lower left), Diarmid a member of Sarevoks group will mistake you for his people and escape. Arcanis and Deder are two more of Serevok's people you will meet near the entrance to the caverns. If you tell Diarmid that you are Prat and talk to him for a while, he will let you pass without a fight.</li>

Within the Seven Suns you will find a merchant who says his fellow merchants are acting strangely so he is leaving and never coming back. The other merchants are really doplegangers. If you talk to them three times they will turn into their true form and attack. Clean out all of the floors including the basement where you will find Jasso.

Aldeth will meet you later on the second level in the merchant league, map 0128. If they have learned anything Aldeth suggests that they talk to Brandilar on the same floor, map 0128, and gives a 300 experience point reward.

The other areas go to the top floor. If you go all the way to the top, you will have a big fight.

On the third floor we told them we were merchants from Sembia. Dustus Gurn, assistant chief accountant, told us that Rieltar and Brunos went to Candlekeep.

                <h3>How does the checklist status get saved?</h3>
                <p>
                    It gets saved to the local storage in your browser and not to any database or API. So if you are
                    clearing your browser cache make sure not to delete the site data or your checklists will
                    get reset. At some point in the future I might hook it up to an API.

                <h3>What else have you got planned?</h3>
                <p>
                    Not much really. I played the EE edition the first time sometimes between 2016 and 2017.
                    Now i'm hunting the remaining achievement and starting the SoD expantion, so I realized I need 
                    a couple more playthrough. This is my favourite guide for vanilla since is quite succint and convers
                    almost anything you need. A cheat sheet is just a more usable format for that.
